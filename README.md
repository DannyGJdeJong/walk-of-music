# walk-of-music

This project was part of the 2019 SIM Studiereis (studytrip) to Bologna, Italy.
It's a simple Python script to be run on a Raspberry Pi connected to 4 pressure sensors and some buttons.
Each of the pressure sensors causes a part of a song to be played and when all sensors are hit in order the entire part of the song will play.
